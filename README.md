Crossword
=========

Automated writing assistant. Crossword helps you finish writing texts that are obstinate. Your document is split into sections, paragraphs, sentences. You are confronted with a single paragraph from the opus, that you can edit, add meta-data (subtext, keywords, ontology), as well as score with a grade. Each time you work with Crossword, it may prompt with a different section, until your text is upto your standards. This way of working frees you from distractions and helps you cope by with the mountains of work ahead one pebble at a time.
